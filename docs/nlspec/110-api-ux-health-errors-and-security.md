# API, UX, Health, Errors, and Security

## Authority

This document is a generated Cadastre NLSpec candidate. It is `migration_active` until the migration ledger marks its source rows complete and `docs/nlspec/120-validation-fixtures-and-acceptance.md` records passing acceptance evidence.

This document owns the contracts listed in `Exports`. Other active Cadastre NLSpecs may import those contracts by exact name and must not restate them.

## Purpose

Define observable API behavior, user-facing states, health, shared error records, security, redaction, and audit behavior.

## Explicit Non-Scope

- Backend query execution internals.
- Raw/silver/gold derivation algorithms.
- Package activation.
- Domain-specific behavior owned by source, identity, temporal, graph, or package specs.

## Imports

- `GraphQueryTranslationProfile`
- `DerivedViewState`
- `IdentityDecision`
- `SourceAuthorityProfile`
- `CadastreSilverObservation`
- `GoldFact`
- `PackageActivationFailureEvent`

## Exports

- `GraphQueryRequest`
- `GraphQueryResponse`
- `AssetSearchRequest`
- `AssetDetailResponse`
- `EvidenceDrillbackResponse`
- `OperationalHealthStatus`
- `SourceStateLabel`
- `ExportStateLabel`
- `ErrorRecord`
- `ErrorCodeRegistry`
- `AuditEvent`
- `RedactionPolicy`
- `AuthorizationDecision`

## Roles

| Role | Required capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| `analyst` | Search assets, view graph relationships, inspect evidence metadata, view conflicts and stale facts. |
| `engineer` | View parser, mapping, resolver, projection, and scoring outputs; run replay in authorized non-production contexts. |
| `operator` | Configure feed profiles, schedules, package versions, deployment profiles, and health alerts. |
| `auditor` | View immutable lineage, version manifests, evidence chains, and access audit records. |
| `admin` | Manage users, roles, retention profiles, production package promotion, and raw evidence access. |

## API Bounds

| API field | Default | Bounds |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Asset search `query` | empty string | Maximum 256 Unicode scalar values after normalization. |
| Asset search `page_size` | 100 | 1 through 1000. |
| Graph query `max_depth` | 3 | 1 through 6. |
| Graph query `page_size` | 100 | 1 through 1000. |
| Graph query `timeout_seconds` | 30 | 1 through 300. |
| `include_raw_payload` | false | Raw payload returned only with raw-evidence permission. |

## Source and Export State Labels

API, UI, evidence drillback, compliance export, audit export, and analysis output must distinguish:

```text
source_stale
derived_view_stale
unknown
not_applicable
authorized_not_observed
permission_limited
source_unavailable
scope_unavailable
partial_known_gap
partial_unknown_gap
not_checked
error
conflicted
ambiguous
```

These labels must not be rendered as authorized negative facts or compliance pass/fail states unless the owning domain spec has emitted the corresponding authoritative output.

## Error Model

`ErrorRecord` must contain stable error code, message, severity, retryability, owner spec, source artifact refs, affected record IDs, correlation ID, and redaction state. Domain-specific codes must be owned by the domain spec; this spec owns the shared shape and generated registry.

Generic error codes must not be used when a more specific domain code exists.

## Evidence Drillback

Graph evidence chain:

```text
Graph node or edge
  -> GoldFact
  -> CadastreSilverObservation or declared derivation input
  -> RawRecord metadata
  -> raw payload only when authorized
```

Missing required lineage refs must return `LINEAGE_ERROR`. Raw payloads must be redacted unless the caller has raw-evidence permission.

## Security and Redaction

- Raw payload exposure requires explicit raw-evidence permission.
- Graph properties derived from raw payloads must pass `GraphPropertyEvidencePolicy` and redaction policy.
- API responses must not leak existence of an inaccessible asset through partial detail responses.
- Public artifacts must not expose private source bindings, route names, credentials, or environment-specific inventories.
- Audit events must record caller, authorization context checksum, operation, input checksum, output object classes, redaction summary, and error code when emitted.

## Definition of Done

| ID | Criterion |
| --- | --- |
| `110-AC-001` | Every observable API outcome has deterministic success, empty-result, redaction, authorization, stale-state, partial-state, and error behavior. |
| `110-AC-002` | Raw payload requests without permission return metadata plus redaction marker, not raw bytes. |
| `110-AC-003` | Source stale and derived-view stale states are never collapsed. |
| `110-AC-004` | Error records include owner spec and use the most specific available error code. |
| `110-AC-005` | Compliance and audit query classes reject stale graph-derived state by default. |

## Open Questions

Open questions marked `TODO:` block authoritative status for the affected contract. A downstream implementation must not resolve a `TODO:` by inference.
