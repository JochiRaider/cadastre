## Authority

This document owns the contracts listed in `Exports`. Other Cadastre NLSpecs may import those contracts by exact name and must not restate them. This document has implementation authority only after the document registry marks it `authoritative` and its acceptance criteria pass.

## Purpose

Define graph read-model construction, graph apply, graph backend profiles, graph query behavior, rebuild, lag, and drift without making the backend authoritative.

## Explicit Non-Scope

- Gold fact authority.
- Identity decisions.
- Source completeness.
- Graph backend product selection.

## Projection Authority

Graph state is a derived read model. It must be rebuildable from authoritative lakehouse records, persisted graph deltas, and active projection/apply/schema profiles.

`GraphNodeDelta` and `GraphEdgeDelta` are concrete 090 records that must conform to `040.GraphNodeDeltaShape` and `040.GraphEdgeDeltaShape` before apply. `090` owns projection/apply semantics and runtime graph delta ID input policies.

A graph backend must not create authoritative facts, infer identity, decide source completeness, decide fact retraction, define bitemporal semantics, repair drift by itself, or expose backend internal IDs as Cadastre IDs.

## Graph artifact activation boundary

Graph authority boundaries, deterministic graph IDs, backend-ID prohibition, query contract, and projection non-authority are stable core contracts. Projection rows, backend profiles, schema profiles, query translation rows, apply profiles, and lag policies are activation-controlled artifacts.

| Artifact or contract | Volatility class | Required handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GraphProjectionProfile` | `activation_controlled_artifact` | Required before graph deltas are projected. |
| `GraphEdgeSemantics` row set | `activation_controlled_artifact` | Must instantiate stable edge semantics contract. |
| `GraphTraversalClass` | stable closed semantics plus activation-controlled inclusion rows where applicable | Parallel traversal eligibility fields are forbidden. |
| `GraphTaxonomyTranslationPolicy` | `activation_controlled_artifact` | Required before external graph taxonomy labels are used. |
| `StructuralGlobalNode` rows | `activation_controlled_artifact` | Disabled by default. |
| `StructuralGlobalNodeAliasPolicy` | `activation_controlled_artifact` | Required before aliases or wildcard-like globals. |
| `GraphBackendProfile` | `activation_controlled_artifact` | Required before mutation, query, rebuild, drift check, or serving promotion. |
| `GraphBackendPreflightResult` | `runtime_state_record` | Runtime validation state. |
| `BackendSchemaFingerprint` | `runtime_state_record` | Runtime schema state. |
| `GraphBackendTaxonomyMappingProfile` | `activation_controlled_artifact` | Required before backend labels/properties are accepted. |
| `GraphQueryTranslationProfile` | `activation_controlled_artifact` | Required before query execution. |
| `GraphReadModelSchemaProfile` | `activation_controlled_artifact` | Required before apply or rebuild promotion. |
| `GraphApplyProfile` | `activation_controlled_artifact` | Required before graph apply. |
| `GraphApplyResult` | `runtime_state_record` | Runtime apply state. |
| `GraphRebuildManifest` | `runtime_state_record` | Rebuild evidence, not authority by itself. |
| `GraphIndexConsistencyCheck` | `runtime_state_record` | Runtime validation state. |
| `DerivedViewLagPolicy` | `activation_controlled_artifact` | Required before serving stale or current graph state. |
| `DerivedViewState` | `runtime_state_record` | Runtime serving state. |

`ProjectGraphDeltas`, `ApplyGraphDelta`, `QueryGraph`, and `RebuildGraph` must validate required activation artifact refs through `030.ActivationControlledArtifactRef` and include every output-affecting ref in `VersionManifest`.

## Graph Delta Identity

Every graph node and edge must have a Cadastre-owned deterministic ID. Backend-generated node, edge, relationship, vertex, document, element, transaction, shard, or native cursor IDs are forbidden as Cadastre IDs, selectors, evidence refs, replay keys, drillback keys, response IDs, or pagination identity and must fail with `GRAPH_BACKEND_ID_FORBIDDEN` before graph apply, query response, evidence ref generation, replay, or pagination.

## Edge Semantics and Traversal

Every active graph edge type must have exactly one `GraphEdgeSemantics` row. The row must define source fact type, source predicate, direction rule, evidence requirements, allowed assertion states, temporal policy, confidence policy, traversal class, non-implication rules, and no-op conditions.

`GraphTraversalClass` is the only traversal eligibility authority. Parallel fields such as `traversal_eligibility`, `reverse_traversal_eligibility`, or `pathfinding_role` are forbidden.

## Backend Preflight

A `GraphBackendProfile` must be active before graph mutation, query, rebuild import, drift check, or graph-serving promotion. `GraphBackendPreflightResult` must validate backend, driver, dialect, topology, storage mode, feature availability, raw-write bypass controls, schema profile, and query translation readiness.

## ApplyGraphDelta Algorithm

```text
ApplyGraphDelta(delta_set, apply_profile):
1. Validate graph projection, backend, schema, taxonomy, query translation, apply, and lag artifact refs through `030.ActivationControlledArtifactRef`.
2. Validate every node and edge delta against `040.GraphNodeDeltaShape`, `040.GraphEdgeDeltaShape`, and `040.ValidateCoreRecord`.
3. Reject backend-generated IDs and raw payload leakage before backend execution.
4. Verify delta_set checksum and GraphDeltaIdempotencyKey.
5. Verify active GraphBackendProfile, GraphReadModelSchemaProfile, and BackendSchemaFingerprint.
6. Reject when backend schema is missing, stale, or fingerprint-mismatched.
7. Sort deltas by apply_profile canonical order.
8. Apply batches only at declared transaction boundaries.
9. Persist backend evidence rows for transaction semantics, failover, read-after-write, storage mode, index freshness, and writer identity when correctness-affecting.
10. On failure, record committed batch IDs or prove no committed writes.
11. Return GraphApplyResult with status, errors, input checksum, backend evidence, idempotency state, artifact refs, and derived view state update eligibility.
```

## QueryGraph Contract

Graph query responses must be sorted by Cadastre-defined ordering, never backend natural order.

Path ordering:

```text
1. shortest path length
2. highest minimum edge confidence, descending
3. most recent maximum edge last_seen, descending
4. path node ID sequence lexical order
```

Graph query bounds:

| Parameter | Default | Minimum | Maximum |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `max_depth` | 3 | 1 | 6 |
| `page_size` | 100 | 1 | 1000 |
| `timeout_seconds` | 30 | 1 | 300 |

A query with an empty `allowed_traversal_classes` set must return no paths rather than traversing all edges.

## Derived View Lag

Every graph-serving response using graph read-model state must include or reference `DerivedViewState`. Compliance, audit, and production rule queries must reject stale graph state by default with `DERIVED_VIEW_LAG_ERROR`.

## Graph Rebuild

`RebuildGraph` must use authoritative lakehouse inputs, persisted graph deltas, active projection/apply/schema profiles, and a declared `GraphRebuildEquivalencePolicy`. Rebuild promotion requires `GraphRebuildManifest` and passing `GraphIndexConsistencyCheck`.

## Drift Check Boundary

`GraphReadModelDriftCheck` is non-authoritative operational health only. A drift check that attempts repair, graph mutation, graph delta emission, authoritative record mutation, or watermark advancement must fail with `GRAPH_DRIFT_REPAIR_FORBIDDEN`.

## Graph Projection Contract Details

### GraphNodeDeltaIdPolicy and GraphEdgeDeltaIdPolicy

`GraphNodeDeltaIdPolicy` and `GraphEdgeDeltaIdPolicy` are owned by `090` because graph runtime identity inputs depend on projection and apply semantics. The policies must use `040.CanonicalJSON`, must not include backend-generated IDs, and must produce byte-identical IDs across replay for the same `GraphDeltaSet`.

| Policy | Required inputs | Forbidden inputs | Missing behavior | Collision behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GraphNodeDeltaIdPolicy` | `projection_profile_id`, `graph_delta_set_id`, `delta_operation`, `graph_node_id`, `node_type`, `source_object_ref`, valid/known interval, assertion state | backend node ID, element ID, storage ID, cursor ID | reject before apply | `GRAPH_NODE_DELTA_ID_COLLISION`; emit no commit before graph apply |
| `GraphEdgeDeltaIdPolicy` | `projection_profile_id`, `graph_delta_set_id`, `delta_operation`, `graph_edge_id`, `edge_type`, endpoint graph node IDs, direction rule, valid/known interval, assertion state | backend relationship ID, edge storage ID, cursor ID | reject before apply | `GRAPH_EDGE_DELTA_ID_COLLISION`; emit no commit before graph apply |

`properties` defaults to `{}`. Every property path must pass `GraphPropertyEvidencePolicy`, redaction checks, and raw payload leakage checks. Non-`no_op` deltas must have evidence refs unless an active graph profile explicitly permits structural synthetic output. `observed_connection` direction must derive from `FlowRoleEvidence`, not OCSF endpoint field order or backend edge convention. `has_theoretical_reachability` remains inactive and fail/no-op in MVP.

### GraphEdgeSemanticsRegistry

| Edge type | Source fact type | Predicate | Direction rule | Evidence | Assertion states | Temporal policy | Confidence policy | Traversal class | Non-implication | No-op | Validation rows | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `observed_connection` | `observed_network_flow_fact` | observed flow relation | `FlowRoleEvidence` only | gold, silver, raw refs | active, stale when allowed | `080` | `090` imports confidence from source fact and `040.DecimalPrecisionPolicy` | `observed_connection_path` | does not imply theoretical reachability | no edge when `FlowRoleEvidence` is missing or ambiguous | `val-090-observed-connection-positive`, `val-090-observed-connection-missing-flow-role` | active_mvp |
| `has_theoretical_reachability` | none in MVP | none | none | none | none | none | none | none | prohibited | fail/no-op | `val-090-theoretical-reachability-prohibited` | inactive_deferred |

The MVP active graph edge set is exactly `observed_connection`. Any additional active edge type requires a new `GraphEdgeSemanticsRegistry` row and validation fixtures before projection activation.

### GraphTraversalClass table

| Traversal class | Pathfinding eligibility | Neighbor expansion eligibility | Reverse traversal behavior | Default inclusion | No-op behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `observed_connection_path` | allowed when query names this class | allowed when edge type filter permits | reverse allowed only as a query traversal over the same observed edge; it must not reverse source direction semantics | excluded unless explicitly requested for path queries | empty allowed traversal classes return no paths |
| `non_traversable` | forbidden | profile-defined display only | none | excluded | edge may be returned as property/detail but not traversed |
| `analysis_only` | forbidden unless `130.RuleGraphCompatibilityMatrix` permits read-only analysis query | read-only | none unless analysis rule permits | excluded | no production graph mutation |

### GraphApplyProfile defaults

| Setting | Default | Maximum | Required behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| batch size | TODO: owner decision required before authoritative promotion | TODO | Missing default blocks production graph apply activation. Do not infer batch size from backend defaults. |
| retry count | TODO: owner decision required before authoritative promotion | TODO | Retryable error classes must be explicit. Do not infer retry count from driver defaults. |
| transaction boundary | one declared batch | n/a | Partial apply must record committed batch IDs or prove no committed writes. |
| partial apply behavior | fail closed unless resume evidence is complete | n/a | Unsafe resume emits `GRAPH_APPLY_RESUME_UNSAFE`. |
| read-after-write proof | required | n/a | Graph apply result must include proof or block derived-view advancement. |
| schema stale behavior | reject | n/a | Emit `GRAPH_SCHEMA_FINGERPRINT_STALE`. |

### GraphQueryTranslationProfile observable contract

| Field | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| stable page token fields | Query checksum, authorization context checksum, ordering keys, page boundary, derived-view state, expiration, and profile refs. |
| backend candidate limit | Must be explicit per query class; TODO owner decision blocks production query activation. |
| timeout behavior | Return `GRAPH_QUERY_TIMEOUT` unless partial results are explicitly permitted for the query class. |
| empty traversal behavior | Empty `allowed_traversal_classes` returns no paths. |
| authorization and redaction | Applied after backend candidate materialization and before response emission. |

### GraphRebuildManifest schema

| Field | Required | Rule |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `input_snapshot_refs` | Yes | Authoritative lakehouse snapshot or dataset refs. |
| `graph_delta_set_refs` | Yes | Persisted graph delta set refs and checksums. |
| `projection_profile_ref` | Yes | Active graph projection profile. |
| `backend_profile_ref` | Yes | Active backend profile. |
| `schema_fingerprint` | Yes | Current backend schema fingerprint. |
| `output_checksum` | Yes | SHA-256 over canonical rebuilt graph-serving output summary. |
| `status` | Yes | success, failed, blocked, or not_run. |
| `errors` | Yes | Default `[]`; owner-specific graph rebuild errors. |

### GraphObjectOutputEligibilityRow

| Object class | Search | Neighbor expansion | Pathfinding | Analysis finding | Metrics | Identity influence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| projected canonical node | profile-defined | profile-defined | traversal-class-defined | read-only | allowed if profile permits | no direct identity mutation |
| projected edge | profile-defined | profile-defined | traversal-class-defined | read-only | allowed if profile permits | no identity authority |
| synthetic structural object | disabled by default | disabled by default | disabled by default | disabled by default | disabled by default | none |
| generic external graph payload | disabled by default | disabled by default | disabled by default | disabled by default | disabled by default | none |

### GraphDeltaIdempotencyKey inputs

| Input order | Input | Required | Rule |
| ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| 1 | `graph_delta_set_checksum` | Yes | SHA-256 lowercase hex. |
| 2 | `graph_apply_profile_id` | Yes | Active profile. |
| 3 | `backend_profile_id` | Yes | Active profile. |
| 4 | `backend_schema_fingerprint` | Yes | Current and non-stale. |
| 5 | `package_set_manifest_checksum` | Yes | Immutable package set. |
| 6 | `target_graph_scope` | Yes | Canonical JSON scope. |

### ResumeGraphApply semantics

| Prior state | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| no prior apply | apply all batches in canonical order. |
| prior identical success | return idempotent no-op result. |
| prior failed before commit | reapply from first batch. |
| prior partial with committed batch evidence | resume after last committed compatible batch. |
| prior partial without committed-batch proof | fail with `GRAPH_APPLY_RESUME_UNSAFE`. |
| idempotency key conflict | fail with `GRAPH_DELTA_IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`. |

### GraphBackendProfile activation fixture matrix

| Backend fixture area | Required evidence | Activation effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| backend and driver | exact backend, driver, version, dialect | blocks backend-specific activation if missing |
| topology and storage mode | writer routing, HA/storage mode, failover semantics | blocks mutation if unsupported |
| raw-write bypass | proof backend console/admin/import bypass is blocked or detected | blocks activation if unsafe |
| schema profile | constraints, indexes, selector indexes, evidence indexes | blocks mutation/query if stale |
| query translation | ordering, pagination, timeout, authorization, redaction | blocks query serving if missing |
| rebuild/import | rebuild manifest, import evidence, index consistency | blocks promotion if missing |

### GraphRebuildEquivalencePolicy boundary

`080` owns checksum rules for replay equivalence. This spec imports `GraphRebuildEquivalencePolicy` by name and defines graph-specific use: rebuild promotion must compare graph-serving output, schema fingerprint, index consistency, delta input set, projection profile, and derived-view state using the imported policy.

### CurrentRecentGraphServingPolicy

MVP graph serving covers current-state and recent-history graph queries. Full historical reconstruction defaults to lakehouse-backed reconstruction outside the graph backend unless a future authoritative graph historical serving policy exists.

### Backend preflight table

| Check | Required evidence | Failure code | Retryability | Activation effect | Validation fixture |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| backend profile active | profile checksum | `GRAPH_BACKEND_PROFILE_MISSING` | no | block | missing profile |
| schema fingerprint current | fingerprint checksum and timestamp | `GRAPH_SCHEMA_FINGERPRINT_STALE` | yes after refresh | block mutation/query | stale fingerprint |
| raw-write bypass controls | audit/control evidence | `GRAPH_RAW_WRITE_BYPASS` | no | block | bypass attempt |
| query translation parity | expected result checksums | `GRAPH_QUERY_TRANSLATION_ERROR` | no | block query serving | parity fixture |
| rebuild equivalence | rebuild checksums and index consistency | `GRAPH_REBUILD_EQUIVALENCE_FAILED` | yes after rebuild | block promotion | rebuild mismatch |

### Graph artifact errors

| Error code | Emitted when |
| --- | --- |
| `GRAPH_ARTIFACT_MISSING` | Required graph projection, backend, schema, query translation, apply, taxonomy, edge semantics, or lag artifact ref is missing. |
| `GRAPH_ARTIFACT_INACTIVE` | Required graph artifact is not active for production execution. |
| `GRAPH_ARTIFACT_CHECKSUM_MISMATCH` | Required graph artifact checksum mismatches the active ref or manifest. |
| `GRAPH_ARTIFACT_SCOPE_MISMATCH` | Required graph artifact does not cover the graph execution, backend, projection, query, or serving scope. |
| `GRAPH_PROJECTION_CORE_OVERRIDE_FORBIDDEN` | A graph projection artifact attempts to redefine core IDs, core schema, identity semantics, temporal semantics, or product authority. |

| `090-VOLATILITY-AC-001` | Inactive graph projection profile, query translation checksum mismatch, apply profile manifest omission, backend ID exposure, and attempted `has_theoretical_reachability` activation fail before mutation or serving. |
| `090-VOLATILITY-AC-002` | Graph apply batch and retry defaults remain blocking `TODO:` rows until owner-supplied default, maximum, and retryable error classes are defined. |

## Open Questions

Open questions marked `TODO:` block authoritative status for the affected contract. A downstream implementation must not resolve a `TODO:` by inference.
